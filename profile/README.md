We utilize cutting-edge technologies such as **multiplexing imaging** and **single cell sequencing** to gain a deeper understanding of the bio markers associated with these conditions. Our team is composed of skilled biologists, physicians and bioinformaticians who work in collaboration to advance our knowledge of these diseases. By integrating the latest technologies and methodologies with the expertise of our experienced researchers, we are able to make significant contributions to the field and improve the lives of patients suffering from lymphomas and inflammatory diseases.
